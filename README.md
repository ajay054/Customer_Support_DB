End-to-End Data Pipeline with Delta Live Tables and Dashboards

Overview This document provides a step-by-step guide to implementing a data pipeline in Databricks using Delta Live Tables (DLT), transforming the data, and creating interactive dashboards for visualization.

Pipeline Overview

Data Source

Source: Azure Blob Storage

Format: Parquet files

Schema: support_id: integer customer_id: integer interaction_date: timestamp issue_description: string resolution_status: string Pipeline Steps

Ingest Raw Data: Read data from Azure Blob Storage into a raw Delta Live Table.
Process Data: Transform and clean data (e.g., casting types, creating calculated fields).
Visualize Data: Use Databricks SQL to create dashboards for interactive analysis.
Create Delta Live Tables (DLT)
Ingest Raw Data

The raw data is read from Azure Blob Storage and stored in a Delta table. Type mismatches are resolved by casting support_id and customer_id to STRING.


# import dlt
# from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# @dlt.table(
#     comment="Raw customer support data ingested from Azure Blob Storage with type casting."
# )
# def raw_customer_support_data():
#     return (
#         spark.read.format("parquet")

Process Data

Create a processed Delta Live Table with calculated fields:

priority: Derived from resolution_status.

Transformations:

High priority: resolution_status = "Unresolved"

Medium priority: resolution_status = "Pending"

Low priority: Default value.


# @dlt.table(
#     comment="Processed customer support data with added transformations."
 )
# def processed_customer_support_data():
#     return (
#         dlt.read("raw_customer_support_data")
#         .withColumn("priority", 
#                     when(col("resolution_status") == "Unresolved", "High")
#                     .when(col("resolution_status") == "Pending", "Medium")
#                     .otherwise("Low"))

Run the Delta Live Table Pipeline
Configure Pipeline:

Target: default schema (or a custom schema configured in the pipeline).

Storage location: Azure Blob Storage.

Start the Pipeline:

Open the Delta Live Tables interface in Databricks.

Run the pipeline in Development Mode for testing.

Once verified, switch to Production Mode.

Create Dashboards in Databricks SQL

Visualizations

Table of Most Repeated Issues


# %sql
# SELECT issue_description, COUNT(*) as count
# FROM processed_customer_support_data
# GROUP BY issue_description
# ORDER BY count DESC
# LIMIT 10;

Visualization: Simple table listing issue descriptions with their counts.

Number of Support Interactions by Priority


# %sql
# SELECT priority, COUNT(support_id) as count
# FROM processed_customer_support_data
# GROUP BY priority
# ORDER BY count DESC;

Visualization: Bar chart showing the count of support interactions by priority.

Resolution Status Distribution

# %sql
# SELECT resolution_status, COUNT(*) as count
# FROM processed_customer_support_data
# GROUP BY resolution_status;

Visualization: Pie chart showing the proportion of records for each resolution status.

Publish Dashboards

Create Dashboard:

Use Databricks SQL to add all visualizations to a single dashboard.

Title: "Customer Support Analysis"

Schedule Refresh:

Configure the dashboard to refresh periodically (e.g., every hour) to ensure updated data.

Share Dashboard:

Share the dashboard with team members or stakeholders for collaborative analysis.

Monitor the Pipeline and Dashboard

Use the Delta Live Tables interface to monitor pipeline runs and ensure data freshness.

Check logs for any failures and troubleshoot as needed.

Best Practices

Data Validation:

Always inspect the source data schema using df.printSchema() before creating Delta Live Tables.

Error Handling:

Use .cast() to handle data type mismatches in the source data.

Pipeline Optimization:

Use mergeSchema if the source schema evolves over time.

Visualization Updates:

Periodically review dashboards to add or modify visualizations based on new requirements.
